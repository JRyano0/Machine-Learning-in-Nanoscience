# Machine Learning in Nanoscience Portfolio

##  About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m a Chemical Nano-Engineering Masterâ€™s student with a B.A. in Nanoscience, with significant interest in using **unsupervised machine learning** to accelerate scientific discoveries at the nanoscale. My work focuses on Python-based algorithm developmentâ€”especially using **NumPy** and **PyTorch** to analyse and interpret spectroscopic data and quantum behaviour.
