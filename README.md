# Machine Learning in Nanoscience Portfolio

##  About Me
👋 Hi! I’m a Chemical Nano-Engineering Master’s student with a B.A. in Nanoscience, with significant interest in using **unsupervised machine learning** to accelerate scientific discoveries in nanoscience. My work focuses on Python-based algorithm development using **NumPy** and **PyTorch** to analyse and interpret spectroscopic data and quantum behaviour.
